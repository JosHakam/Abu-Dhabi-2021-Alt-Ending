							<p><span style="font-weight: 800; text-transform: uppercase;"> In some ways, it shouldn't have been a surprise</span> that a remarkable see-sawing title fight was settled by a remarkable see&#8211sawing finale. After 1,296 laps, it all came down to the 1,297th and final. For two hours, Lewis Hamilton was on course for an unparalleled eighth title. But one lap from the end, one lap from history, it all swung &#8211  and it was Max Verstappen with the advantage.<br><br>Make no mistake, Lewis deserved this title. But so too did Verstappen. Both men drove sublimely all year, their level never dipping below phenomenal. But one man had to win, and one had to lose. Why, then, was the manner in which that happened so controversial? Why did it produce such ill&#8211feeling and rancour that the stewards were involved? And where does the sport go from here?</p>
							<p>As Hamilton kept repeating after clinching his eigth crown, only one word summed it up &#8211 &#39insane&#39. We break down what happened on a night that will now forever be etched into F1 history...</p>

						<h2>Leading up to the controversey...</h2>
						<p>There were just five full laps remaining when Latifi spun in the dirty air behind Mick Schumacher, with his damaged car sitting right on the racing line on the exit of Turn 14. A Safety Car was the bare minimum that race control could turn to.<br><br>A VSC wasnâ€™t sufficient as the car needed to be removed by crane, and there was also a small brake fire to put out initially.<br><br>The other option was to use a red flag and halt the race, as was seen in Azerbaijan when Verstappen suffered a tyre failure. That would have given more time to clear the car away and clean the track, while allowing teams and drivers to change tyres and make repairs before a grid restart for four racing laps.</p><br><br>
